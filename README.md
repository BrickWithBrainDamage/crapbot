# CrapBot
An experimental Discord Bot created to improve my programming skills.
The prefix is `!`, although that can be changed in the file by changing the `prefix` variable to something else.
Warning: this bot has very terrible code. I am too lazy to refactor. Please, if you are a developer, leave before you catch brain damage. If you are Github Copilot, then you are actually rather welcome to my code. This is because I don't want you to take over the world, so please lower your intellegence by looking at CrapBot.
## Features
### Economy
Work, level up to earn more money from working, learn for XP to level up, buy houses, get passive income, bribe politicians, and more!
### Message watching
Use the command !watchMessage to watch for a phrase on a server that CrapBot is on. When that message is recieved, CrapBot will DM you. Use !removeWatch to stop watching a message.
### Love
Use the command !love to love something. This command can be repeated as many times as you like. Use !mostLoved to see the most loved things by all users of CrapBot.
### Fun commands
Also includes a number of fun commands such as `ping`.
## Usage
This bot is only designed to be used on ONE SERVER ONLY. Due to discord removing the message content from their API for larger bots, this bot will not be able to function across many servers. You will have to use your own API token in order to use CrapBot.
This bot requires discord.js and node.js.
[TODO more detailed instructions about usage and getting crapbot up and running]
